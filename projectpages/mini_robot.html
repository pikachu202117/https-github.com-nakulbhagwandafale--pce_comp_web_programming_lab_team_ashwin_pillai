    <h1>Are you ready to build MINI ROBO with  ADDS!!!</h1>
    <h2>Here is the list of components you will be needing. </h2>
    <div class="it">
        <ol type="1">
           <li>  2 x bits of wire</li>
           <li>1 x 3v motor</li> 
           <li> 1 x AA battery</li> 
           <li>3 x beads (a third one too if wanted)</li> 
           <li> 2 x pieces of foamboard (or more if desired)</li> 
            <li> Some legs (your choice what materials, we used paper clips, the instructions so toothbrush heads, the above show drawing pins)</li> 
            <li>A Hot Glue Gun</li>
            <li>Cardboard</li> 
           <li>Scissors</li> 
           <li>Multipurpose glue</li>

    <h2>simply follow are easy steps to build your own project.so here we goo!!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>step 1: Securing the battery to your motor: <br>Glue the bigger piece of foamboard onto the Motor with the metal contacts at the top. </h3>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/mini-robot-base.jpg.webp"></div></li>
        <li><h3> step 2: Unbalancer:<br> Now this step may seem a little random. but what you are doing is “unbalancing” the motor, which in turn creates the movement of the little thing. So make sure you don’t skip this bit! Glue a small piece of foam board onto the end of the motor to help unbalance your robot. You can also stick a bead on if you wish. Leave this all to dry for a couple of minutes.</h3>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/mini-robot-unbalancer.jpg.webp"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 3:  Legs: <br>You now need to stick your robots legs onto the bottom of the motor. If using toothbrushes, you might want to stick some foamboard in between. Leave to dry for a couple of minutes.</h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="mini-robot-legs.png.webp"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 4: Connecting to your Motor:<br> You can either “twist” them on or solder them on. Soldering will probably give your little robot more longevity, but isn’t strictly necessary.<br>Take your pieces of wire and solder one of each onto a metal contact on the motor. This is quite fiddly so be careful. The best technique is to hold the iron on the metal Contact and bring the solder towards it, letting it melt onto the contact and form a seal. Make sure that you frequently wipe the solder iron with a sponge to get any burnt solder off it.</h3>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/mini-robot-soldering.jpg.webp"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 5:  Connecting to the Battery:<br> Using your hot glue one of your wires to one end of your battery, your choice which one. It is very important that you create a contact between the wire and the battery – too much glue and you will seal the wire… for some reason, I “just couldn’t get this bit right”, so on MY mini robot, I used some electrical tape. Glueing is better though.
        </h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/mini-robot-batter-motor.jpg.webp"></div></li>
       <li><h3>step 6: Eyes:<br> Now stick your robot’s eyes on the appropriate end of the battery. Either end is fine, just choose and end that you like</h3></li> 
       <li><h3>step 7:  Final Connection:<br> Now to make your robot move! Take your second wire and stick it to the non wired end of your battery using some tape. By doing this rather than using the glue gun you have flexibility on when the motor is on or off.</h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="soldering-finished.jpg.webp"></div></li>
