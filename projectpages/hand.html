    <h2>simply follow are easy steps to build your own project.so here we goo!!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>step 1:   When cutting notches in the straw with a craft knife, always cut away from you for safety. </h3><br><p>To protect your work surface, place a piece of cardboard on the table (or ask an adult if you can borrow a cutting board from the kitchen).<br>
            With the help of a parent, use the X-ACTOÂ® knife, scissors or punch to cut several notches of different shapes and sizes. Each notch should be at least 2 centimeters (cm) apart. For safety's sake, always place the straw down on your cutting surface and point the knife blade away from you (as shown in Figure 1).<br>
            Put your finger on the back of the straw and bend it as shown in Figure 2. Is it easy to bend? Does it spring back nicely or does it stay bent after you let go?<br>
            Try making the cut less deep and leave more straw. Does this make it easier or harder to bend? Is it more or less springy?
            You can also try using a scrap-booking punch on half of the straw to punch out a section (as shown in Figure 3) rather than using the knife or scissors.</p>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/img2.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3> step 2: Press the cut straw into a curve to see whether the notches you cut make good joints.
        </h3>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/img3.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 3:  As a safer alternative to using a craft knife, squeeze the straw into the scrap-booking punch about halfway and punch out a notch. One point of a star-shaped punch does a great job.</h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img4.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 4:Preparing the Straws</h3>
           <p> Here is a tip we found when testing this project. In order for the fingers to bend nice and straight, it is helpful to make sure there is a straight line running down the length of the straw. Cut the notches centered on this line. If the brand of straw you chose already has a straight line or lines as part of its design, skip this section and go on to Making the First Finger. Otherwise, mark each straw with a straight line.<br>
            Find a straight edge at least as long as the straw that is half as high as the straw is wide. For example, if you found straws 8 mm in diameter, your straight edge should be 4 mm thick. Your ruler may have a nice metal edge. If you place it flat on the table, is the edge 4 mm off the surface? You may be able to cut a thin piece of cardboard (a shim) to raise that metal edge up until it is 4 mm from the table.<br>
            Place the ruler and the cardboard shim on the table. Have a friend help you hold it firmly to the table or tape it down. You don't want it to move during this step.<br>
            Place one of your straws up against the edge of the ruler. Use your fine-tip marker and run a line down the length of the straw as shown in Figure 4. Hold the straw up to your eye like a telescope and look down the length. The line should be straight. Repeat this step with your remaining straws.</p>
            
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/img5.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 5:Marking a straight line down the length of the straw helps keep the joints lined up so the finger bends more naturally.
        </h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/img6.jpg"></div></li>
       <li><h3>step 6:Making the First Finger</h3>
         <p>Hold the straw up next to your finger. With the other hand (you can also have a friend help you), mark the straw where the joints should go (generally about 2 cm apart). Starting at the finger tip, measure from the end and make a mark where the first joint will go. You will be cutting out the section from the side where you drew the line earlier. Make your mark on that side. Continue from there, measuring and marking the joints. An example is shown in Figure 5 below</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img7.jpg"></div></li> 
       <li><h3>step 7: Mark each joint in the finger to make a robot finger that bends like yours.
    </h3><p>Somewhere in the middle of your hand, mark the straw so you know where to cut it to length. Keep the straw at its full length for now.
        Place the straw flat on the surface with the line facing up. Make the cuts for each notch according to the technique you developed earlier. (See Figure 6 for an example.) When you have finished, try bending all of the joints at the same time. The straw should gently form a nice curve if you lined up all of the cuts along the straight line you drew.</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img8.jpg"></div></li> 
         <li><h3>step 8:Cutting the joints of the finger so they nicely line up creates a finger with a nice curve.</h3>
         <p>Cut the straw to length with your scissors. The length will depend on your design. Make sure to leave the straw long enough to attach to the 'palm' or main structure of your robot hand.
           <br> Cut a piece of thread at least four times the length of the finger. Close to one end, tie a nice fat knot. A figure eight knot is a good knot for the job. Thread the other end through the needle.
           <br> Stick the needle (carefully!) through the straw just above one of the joints (as shown in Figure 7a). Using the needle-nose pliers or a chop stick (as shown in Figure 7b), pass the needle down the length of the straw until it comes out of the opposite end of the straw. Repeat steps 6 and 7 with threads on the other joints. In case your knot slips trough the hole created by the needle, a drop of glue or nail polish may help secure the knot</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img9.jpg"></div></li> 
<li><h3>step 9: (7a, left; 7b, right). Push the needle carefully into the straw just above the joint (7a). Work it through with the help of a chop stick and pass it down the length of the straw (7b).
</h3><p>Cut the threads from the joints so they are all the same length, at least a few inches from the end of the straw. Tie one of your rings to each thread (see the example in Figure 8)</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img10.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 10:. A finger with three joints and one tendon for each joint. Pulling a ring makes the joint it is attached to bend.
        </h3><p>With one hand, hold the straw upright, and place fingers from the other hand through the rings. Gently pull the rings one at a time and see what happens. Can you bend each of the joints independently? Look at your index finger again and see if you can bend each of the joints independently. Is your straw finger different than your real one? Is it the same?<br>Can you bend the joint closest to the fingertip without bending the others? Can you guess why? Can you bend your real finger that way? Because of the way the tendons in a real finger work, it is almost impossible to bend just the one joint.</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img10.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 11:Assembling the Robot Hand.</h3><p>Now that you have made one finger that is a lot like a human finger, it is time to make your complete robot hand. Using your design sketches and the techniques you just practiced, make several fingers. Cut as many straws as you need into as many fingers as your plan calls for. You can use thread tendons on each joint if you like. Or to make the hand simpler to control, you may decide to simply use one tendon per finger. If you do that, connect it to the joint closest to the fingertip.
           <br> Think about how your own hand has the fingers attached around the palm of your hand. Your robot hand needs some structure to join the fingers as well. Attach all of the fingers together in some way so that they look like the robot hand you designed. You can glue them to cardboard or wood, or mold some polymer clay around the straws. If you decide to use the clay, form the clay around the straws and then remove the straws, as shown in Figure 9. Have an adult help you bake the clay in the oven according to the manufacturer's directions. When the clay has cooled, reinsert the straws.</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img10.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 12: Mold the polymer clay around the straws first, then remove the straws and bake the clay according to directions. The small strip shown here could be part of a larger 'palm'.</h3><p>Our test robot hands are shown in Figure 10, but yours will look different. Just as an idea, you can have a thumb jointed separately and have a rubber band in the back provide the return spring. A medical glove can help if the fingers are a little too slippery. Besides gloves (or just the glove fingers) for extra grip, you can also use skinny balloons of the kind used to twist balloon animals.</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img10.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 13: The hands we made at Science Buddies to test this project. Since our hands are shaped somewhat like a human hand, it fits inside a medical glove which makes the fingers a little less slippery.</h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="img10.jpg"></div></li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Hold the robot hand steady on a support or have a friend help you. Place your fingers in the rings and pull the tendons. Do the fingers curl correctly? Does it look like it closes and grabs the way you planned it?
        See if your robot hand will pick up the object or grab the item or do whatever you designed it to do. If it does, congratulations! Can it do a better job? What could you do to improve it? If it can't pick up or grab the object, why not? This is your chance to figure what went wrong and make changes, or just make it better. Are the fingers too long? Too short? Do they bend in the right place? Try some experiments to figure it out then go back and remake the parts.
        Use your robot hand to pat yourself on the back - you did it!</h2></div></section>
