    <p>Due to increasing costs, going to the grocery store can be more challenging, and many people have modified their grocery shopping habits by reducing the frequency with which they go grocery shopping, which may limit the opportunity to buy the most perishable greens.<br><br> Many are investing in a home garden to grow their own fresh vegetables while re-discovering the beneficial de-stress effects of gardening. If you do not have space for a garden, believe that you do not have a "green thumb," or are discouraged by your previous gardening experiences, do not despair! Microgreens may provide you with a new opportunity.</p>
    <h1>What You Needed to Grow Microgreens at Home</h1>
       <p> Microgreen production for self-consumption in a household does not require using any special tool, and besides the seeds, you should be able to find everything you need at home or in any household product store. If you plan to grow microgreens continuously for more efficient production, buying some growing trays and small tools specifically designed to produce microgreens might be convenient.
        <h4> The basic items you need are:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Seeds</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Growing containers or tray</li>
        <li>Measuring cup</li>
        <li>Plastic cups</li>
        <li>Spray bottle and pitcher</li>
        <li>A sharp knife or a pair of scissors</li>
        </ul>
      you may need a few cups for soaking the seeds in water and a small colander to rinse the seeds once or twice before germination. You need a clean surface or shelf to place the growing trays depending on where you plan to grow microgreens. While the natural sunlight available behind a window, on a balcony, or a small porch is generally enough to grow microgreens.
       <h2>Here he are ready for Growing Migrogreens</h2> 
       <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1. Take Requried Amount Of Microgreen Seeds:</h4>
            <p>If You are Growing Seeds in Tray then Spoon full of seeds are much sufficient. if your using some other container then you can refer Microgreens Seed Density Calculator (simply click on this you will be redirected to page).</p>

        <li><h4>Step 2. Prepare you trya/container for growing:</h4><p>Trays and or containers of different shapes and sizes may be used to plant microgreens. Since microgreens do not require a lot of medium to grow on, flat trays are generally preferred over regular nursery pots. While microgreen planting trays of different sizes may be purchased from different sources, recycling containers deriving from food packaging is also possible. The main recommendation is to make sure you are using material that is suitable for food production, that it's clean, and that the trays have drainage holes at the bottom. This will allow you to water the trays from the bottom without letting the water contact the greens, enabling the excess water to drain. 
<div class="container"><img class="tray1" src="../img/tray1.jpg"></div>
<div class="container"><img class="tray2" src="../img/tray2.jpg"></div><br>filling or setting the trays with the growing medium, using a clean container without holes and filled with drinking water, you can slowly wet the growing medium from the bottom, and once the medium is wet enough, let the excess water drain. The moisture of the medium will help tiny seeds stick to the surface and keep the seeds moist during germination</p></li>
        <li><h4>step 3. place your seeds in tray/container:</h4><p>At this point, you can start seeding by evenly distributing the defined amount of microgreen seeds on the entire growing area of each tray. Most of the microgreen seeds do not require any treatment. However, for some species characterized by larger seeds or a hard seed shell, the germination process may accelerate if seeds are pre-soaked in water. Seeds can be soaked in water overnight for 8-12 hours. During this process, it is beneficial to rinse the seeds in running water a couple of times to wash the seeds and let them get some oxygen.<br>Distributing the seeds on the growing medium surface, it is not necessary, and it could be better not to cover the seeds with soil so that the sprouts remain clean. After seeding, It is enough to apply some water, occasionally using a spray bottle to keep the seed moist during germination. It is recommended to keep the seeds in a dark environment for a few days to facilitate the germination process and keep a good moisture level during the germination. This can be easily achieved by covering the microgreen trays with something that can block the sunlight.Use a spray bottle for misting water on the seeds after seeding.after few hour it will sprout.</p>

<li><h4>step 4. now its time to Harvest:</h4>
<p>after gap of 6-8 days or around 1 week your microgreens are ready to harvest.<br>After harvesting your microgreens, if your growing medium is organic, you can compost it and wash and reuse your planting trays or containers.</p>
