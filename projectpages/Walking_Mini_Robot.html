    <h2>simply follow are easy steps to build your own project.so here we goo!!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>step 1:Build the robot's legs as shown in Figure 2. </h3><p>Cut a short piece of the wooden dowel (a few centimeters long). Since this is an engineering design project, exact lengths are not given. You can experiment with the linkage design to see how it affects your robot's motion.<br>
            Cut a second, shorter piece of the dowel, and glue it to one end of the first piece at a 90 degree angle as shown.<br>
            Cut a longer piece of the wooden skewer, and glue it to the center of the first dowel piece at a 90 degree angle as shown.<br>
            Cut a piece of the popsicle stick and glue it to the bottom of the first dowel piece to make a foot.
            Repeat this process to build the second leg, which should be a mirror image of the first leg</p>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/walking-robot-legs.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3> step 2:  The robot's legs.</h3><p> Note that the legs are mirror images of each other.<br>
            Glue short pieces of straw to the motor's shaft as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The straw pieces should be on opposite sides of the shaft (one should be on the "top" while the other is on the "bottom").</p>
       </li>
        <li><h3>step 3: Side view of a straw piece glued to the motor's shaft.
        </h3><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/walking-robot-straws-side.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 4: Front view of straws glued to motor shaft.</h3><p> Note how one straw is on the top while the other is on the bottom.<br>
            Build a rear support for the robot as shown in Figure 5.<br>
            Cut two pieces of the wooden dowel and glue them vertically to the sides of the motor.
            Glue a piece of the popsicle stick to the bottom of the dowels.<br>
            Cut two pieces of the straw and glue them horizontally in the middle of the dowels.</p>
        <div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/walking-robot-straws-front.jpg"></div></li>
        <li><h3>step 5:  Rear view of the robot's rear support.
        </h3><p>Apply beads of glue to the bottoms of your robot's feet (but not the rear support) to give them more grip.<br>
            Place the legs into the straws to form the slider-crank mechanism, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
            Slide the long wooden skewer through the horizontal straw attached to the rear support.
<br>            Slide the short wooden dowel into the straw that is glued to the motor shaft.
            </p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/robot-rear-support.jpg"></div></li>
       <li><h3>step 6:Side view of the slider crank mechanism.</h3><p>Use double-sided foam tape to attach the battery to the top of the motor, as shown in Figure 7.</p><div class="container1"><img class="img1" src="../img/walking-robot-slider-crank.jpg"></div></li>   
       <li><h3>step 7:Battery taped to the top of the robot.</h3><p>old your robot up in the air and plug the motor pins into the battery connector. If the motor's shaft spins the wrong way (such that the robot would walk backwards), reverse the pins.<br>
        Gently place your robot down and watch it walk! Observe your robot carefully to see what happens. If it falls over or the legs fall out, you may need to adjust your mechanism, for example by changing the length of a straw or dowel piece. You can do this by carefully peeling off the glue and re-gluing a new piece. If you make changes, they should be symmetric (on both sides of the robot), but otherwise you should only change one thing at a time before you re-test your robot.<br>
        Apply the engineering design process to try and improve your robot's design. How does changing the linkage design affect your robot's speed? You may find it easier to buy more parts and build multiple robots so you do not have to keep peeling glue off your first robot (Figure 8).
